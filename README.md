# TOML - Android String.xml Plugin

This plugin is designed to facilitate the conversion of TOML files into Android `strings.xml` files.

To use this plugin, follow these steps:

1. Create your TOML file under the project root folder like `<Project Root Folder>/toml/anyname.toml`.
2. To support multiple languages, name the file with the language code as the extension. For example:
    - `<code>anyname_en.toml</code>` for English
    - `<code>anyname_fr.toml</code>` for French

   These files with language extensions will be placed under corresponding `<code>values-</code>` directories in Android projects (e.g., `<code>values-en</code>` for English).
